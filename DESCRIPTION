Description: This package implements a pairwise global sequence alignment method.
    The objective is to find the optimal global sequence alignment between two nucleotide 
    sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. It also provides functions to calculate
    separately the score matrix and the direction matrix with alignment.
